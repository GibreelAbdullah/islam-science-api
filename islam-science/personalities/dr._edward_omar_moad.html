<p>Dr. Edward Omar Moad earned his PhD in Philosophy from the University of Missouri &ndash; Columbia in 2004 and is
    Associate Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Humanities, Qatar University. He has published numerous
    articles on Islamic philosophy and comparative moral epistemology, as well as a textbook, Logic and Critical
    Thinking: An Introduction for Muslim Students (2017: Kazi Publications). His research is in the area of Islamic
    philosophy, metaphysics, and comparative moral epistemology, and coalesces in two distinct yet related projects,
    which I he has named <em>Coherence of the Incoherence</em>, and <em>Values without Borders</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Coherence of the Incoherence</em> focuses on the famous debate between Ibn Sina, Al-Ghazali, and Ibn Rushd, as
    recorded in Ghazali&rsquo;s Incoherence of the Philosophers and Ibn Rushd&rsquo;s Incoherence of the Incoherence.
    The project culminates in my recent book, Coherence of the Incoherence: Between Al-Ghazali and Ibn Rushd on Nature
    and the Cosmos (2023, Gorgias Press), and also includes several academic papers and book chapters on a range of
    related topics in the intersection of Islamic philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of religion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Values without Borders</em> aims at discovering a grounded moral epistemology, sustainable in the face of the
    increasing cultural and historical diversity that confronts the thinking human being (and in particular the thinking
    Muslim) in the contemporary world. This project includes analyses of the moral epistemologies of key Muslim
    thinkers, exploratory comparisons between the axiological paradigms and moral epistemologies of various ethical
    traditions, and theoretical inquiries into whether and how such comparisons might be philosophically productive in
    the effort to better understand how we ought to live in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
