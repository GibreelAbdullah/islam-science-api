    "data":"<p>Dr. Mohammed Basil Altaie is a distinguished Professor of Quantum Cosmology at Yarmouk University in Jordan, renowned for his contributions to theoretical physics, quantum cosmology, and the intersection of Islamic philosophy and science. Born in Mosul, Iraq in 1952, Dr. Altaie&rsquo;s intellectual journey has shaped him into one of the leading voices in bridging modern physics with Islamic theology. His research focuses on quantum field theory, general relativity, and their philosophical implications, particularly in relation to Islamic theism.</p><p>Dr. Altaie began his academic career by earning a&nbsp;Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Physics&nbsp;from the&nbsp;University of Mosul&nbsp;in 1974. His early interest in the subject led him to publish a book on&nbsp;general and special relativity&nbsp;while still a student&mdash;an achievement that demonstrated his precocious understanding of complex scientific theories. Shortly thereafter, he received a&nbsp;PhD in Theoretical Physics&nbsp;from the&nbsp;University of Manchester&nbsp;in 1978.</p><p>At the heart of Dr. Altaie&rsquo;s work is his argument that&nbsp;quantum indeterminacy&nbsp;supports the philosophical underpinnings of&nbsp;Islamic theism. He proposes that the universe is both predictable, as evidenced by the laws of nature, and indeterministic, indicating that these laws are not absolute but rather contingent upon a&nbsp;Divine Creator. According to Dr. Altaie, the&nbsp;order of the natural world&nbsp;reflects divine wisdom, while its&nbsp;unpredictability&nbsp;points to a state of&nbsp;continuous creation&nbsp;by God. In addition to his contributions to quantum cosmology, Dr. Altaie has written extensively on the relationship between Islam and modern science. His works examine how Quranic insights can be interpreted in light of modern scientific discoveries, particularly in the realms of physics and cosmology.</p><p>Dr. Altaie&rsquo;s work has had a profound impact on the dialogue between&nbsp;Islam and science. He stands among a growing number of Muslim scholars who reject the notion of an inherent conflict between&nbsp;faith&nbsp;and&nbsp;reason. Instead, Dr. Altaie argues that the&nbsp;uncertainties&nbsp;inherent in&nbsp;quantum mechanics&nbsp;can actually support the concept of&nbsp;continuous divine creation, thus offering a unique blend of&nbsp;scientific rigor&nbsp;and&nbsp;theological insight.</p>"
