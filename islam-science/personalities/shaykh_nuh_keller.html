<p>Shaykh Nuh Keller was born in 1954 and raised as a Roman Catholic in rural Washington State. He is a third-generation American of German ancestry on his father&rsquo;s side, and German, Scottish, and Irish on his mother&rsquo;s. During the 1970&rsquo;s and 1980&rsquo;s between his academic studies and work as a commercial fisherman in the North Pacific, he underwent a journey of reflection that culminated in his becoming Muslim. Nearly three decades later, he has become one of the most authoritative voices of traditional, moderate Islam in the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Nuh studied philosophy, focusing on the epistemology of ethical theory, with Andrew J. Bjelland at Gonzaga University and with the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur, author of&nbsp;<em>The Symbolism of Evil</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Conflict of Interpretations</em>, at the University of Chicago. He became interested in the Qur&rsquo;an and began studying Classical Arabic at Chicago in 1975. He traveled to Cairo, Egypt in 1976, where he became Muslim at the famed al-Azhar University in 1977. He completed a graduate degree in philosophy from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1979.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later that year he returned to the Middle East to pursue private studies with Islamic scholars in Syria and Jordan. In Damascus, he read Shafi&rsquo;i jurisprudence (fiqh) and tenets of faith (&lsquo;aqida) with Sheikh &lsquo;Abd al-Wakil al-Durubi, and Sufism and tenets of faith with Sheikh &lsquo;Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri. In Amman, he read Shafi&rsquo;i fiqh and Qur&rsquo;an recital (tajwid) with Sheikh Yunus Hamdan, Hanafi fiqh with Sheikh Ahmad al-Khudari, Shafi&rsquo;i fiqh and tenets of faith with Sheikh Nuh &lsquo;Ali Salman al-Qudah, prophetic aphorisms and practices (hadith) and Hanafi fiqh with Sheikh Shu&rsquo;ayb al-Arna&rsquo;ut, and Hanafi fiqh and tenets of faith with Sheikh Ahmad al-Jammal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1982 he took the Shadhili&nbsp;<em>tariqa</em>&nbsp;from Shaghouri in Damascus. Though often separated from him for extended periods of time due to political exigencies, Keller assiduously applied the teachings of the Shadhili&nbsp;<em>tariqa</em>&nbsp;and Islamic Sacred Law. Nearly 15 years after first taking Keller as his student, Shaghouri in 1996 invested him as a full sheikh of the&nbsp;<em>tariqa</em>&nbsp;to guide disciples to&nbsp;<em>ihsan</em>, or &ldquo;worshipping Allah as though you see Him,&rdquo; as defined by Islamic tradition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to teaching Sufism, Shaykh Nuh Keller has written several books and articles on a wide range of subjects. Perhaps his most important work to date is the voluminous&nbsp;<em>Reliance of the Traveler</em>, an annotated English translation of&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;Umdat al-Salik</em>, a Shafi&rsquo;i legal work by Ahmad ibn Naqib al-Misri (d.769/1368). It contains over six thousand legal rulings, and was the first English translation of an Islamic legal work to be certified by al-Azhar University. The translation was begun in 1982 and reviewed over a course of five years with Sheikh &lsquo;Abd al-Wakil al-Durubi and Sheikh Nuh Ali Salman al-Qudah, both of whom gave written certifications to him for it. Since its first publication in 1990, over thirty thousand copies have been printed. It has not only gained a wide readership among Western Muslims, but has also become the standard reference for non-Muslim academics in America and Britain who teach Islamic jurisprudence at university level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other works include&nbsp;<em>Port in a Storm</em>, a comprehensive treatment of the Muslim direction of prayer, as well as a short account of the author&rsquo;s conversion entitled&nbsp;<em>Becoming Muslim.</em>&nbsp;Keller has also produced a number of&nbsp;<em>tariqa</em>-related literature and recordings, including a translation of selected Shadhili litanies and a booklet explaining the practices and structure of the&nbsp;<em>tariqa</em>&nbsp;entitled&nbsp;<em>The High Path</em>. Sheikh Nuh continues to divide his time between translating, writing, and teaching disciples about the Sufi path. He resides with his wife in Amman, Jordan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Nuh has written <em>Islam and Evolution: a letter to Suleman Ali</em> where he discusses evolution from an Islamic perspective. He has also written a series of articles where he provides guidance regarding the use to digital devices and other modern technologies, focusing on how Muslims can maintain a good spiritual life in modern times. He also provides guidance on healthy living in modern times, maintaining physical and spiritual well-being in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
