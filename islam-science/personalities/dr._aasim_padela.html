<p class="h2 text-center py-4">Dr. AASIM I. PADELA</p>
<p>Dr. Aasim I. Padela&nbsp;is a globally recognized expert in the fields of&nbsp;emergency medicine,&nbsp;bioethics,
    and the&nbsp;medical humanities, with a unique focus on the intersection of&nbsp;healthcare, religion, and
    bioethics. As the&nbsp;Director of the Program on Medicine and Religion&nbsp;at the&nbsp;University of Chicago
    Medicine, Dr. Padela has made significant contributions to advancing understanding in the areas of clinical ethics,
    medical practice, and religious perspectives in healthcare. His work in bioethics, public health, and medicine has
    led to his becoming a sought-after consultant for international organizations, legislative bodies, and courts,
    making him a key figure in discussions surrounding healthcare and religion on a global scale.</p>
<p>Dr. Padela holds an MD from Weill Cornell Medical College and an MSc in Healthcare Research from the University of
    Michigan. He also holds a BS in Biomedical Engineering and a BA in Classical Arabic from the University of
    Rochester. He completed emergency medicine training at the University of Rochester, a research fellowship at the
    University of Michigan, a clinical medical ethics fellowship at the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at
    the University of Chicago and visiting fellowships at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies and the International
    Institute for Islamic Thought. He has authored over 150 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters and one
    monograph&nbsp;<em>Maqasid al-Shariah and Biomedicine: Bridging Moral, Ethical and Policy Discourses</em>&nbsp;(IIIT
    Press 2024). He is also editor/co-editor of four books.</p>
<p>As a scholar, Dr. Padela&rsquo;s focus is on the intersections of healthcare, bioethics, and religion. Overall, his
    scholarship aims at improving health and healthcare through better accommodating religious values in healthcare
    delivery. Using Muslim Americans and Islam as a model, he studies how (i) religion impacts patient health behaviors
    and healthcare experiences, (ii) informs the professional identities and workplace experiences of clinicians, and
    (iii) furnishes bioethical guidance to patients, providers, policy-makers, and religious leaders. This knowledge is
    subsequently mobilized towards educational and policy interventions. His projects cover critical issues related to
    cancer screening, organ donation, end-of-life care, and the intersection of religion and science.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Aasim Padela&rsquo;s impact on the fields of&nbsp;bioethics,&nbsp;emergency medicine, and&nbsp;Islamic medical
    ethics&nbsp;is profound. His multidisciplinary approach to&nbsp;religion and healthcare&nbsp;has significantly
    influenced how healthcare providers address the spiritual and religious needs of their patients. Through his
    teaching, research, and public health work, Dr. Padela continues to push the boundaries of how faith and medicine
    intersect, ensuring that healthcare systems remain inclusive and sensitive to diverse religious values.</p>
