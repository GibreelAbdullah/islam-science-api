<p class="h2 text-center py-4">SHAYKH HAMZA KARAMALI</p>
<p>Shaykh Hamza Karamali earned his BASc And MASc in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, after which he
    moved abroad to study the Islamic sciences full-time in private one-on-one settings with distinguished traditional
    scholars in Kuwait, UAE, and Jordan, reading and memorizing traditional works in all of the Islamic sciences, and
    earning Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s degrees in Islamic Law and Legal Theory from Jamia Nizamiyya in
    Hyderabad, India. He specializes in developing authentically Muslim responses to the problem of atheism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He taught the Islamic sciences online at SunniPath.com, then at Qibla.com, then taught advanced Arabic grammar and
    rhetoric at Qasid Institute, and then joined Kalam Research &amp; Media, where he worked for three years, designing,
    managing, and participating in research and education projects around the integration of modern analytic philosophy
    and science with traditional Islamic theology and logic. He is the author of The Madrasa Curriculum in Context. He
    also taught at SeekersGuidance where he taught courses on logic, legal theory, and Islamic theology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 2019, he founded Basira Education to fill a gap in the religious education of Muslims in the modern
    world &mdash; his goal at Basira is to develop a deploy an original seminary-level curriculum that is grounded in
    the traditional Islamic sciences but fully integrates modern science and culture into an intelligent and
    God-centered worldview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More recently, he has launched WhyIslamIsTrue.com where he teaches the rational arguments for the proof of Islam in a
    simple interactive and relevant manner. He trains parents, teachers, and scholars how to protect Muslim children
    from losing their Deen. Why Islam is True is a contemporary application of the classical curriculum of the elite
    madrasas of al-Azhar (of old), al-Zaytuna (of old), al-Qarawiyyin (of old), the Ottoman empire, and the Farangi
    Mahall and Deoband (of old). It is being widely endorsed and adopted by scholars and seminaries all over the world.
    He is about to publish two comprehensive manuals that will present the technical kalam and mantiq insights that he
    has gathered over the past two decades working in the field of rational arguments for the truth of Islam. The first
    is called <em>Kalam 3.0: The Muslim Manual of Logical Arguments to Show the Truth of Islam in the 21st Century</em>.
    The second is called <em>Discerning Religious Truth:&nbsp; A Didactic Exposition of the Logic and Epistemology of
        the Islamic Sciences</em>. These are meant for study in a seminary setting to ground the Why Islam is True
    course in the Muslim scholarly tradition and to demonstrate how to apply that tradition to critically engage with
    modern challenges to the truth of Islam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also contributes to the field of Islam and Science through his online courses, videos and articles, with highly
    relevant content based on traditional Islamic Kalam tradition. His video series God&rsquo;s Cosmos explores the
    religious, philosophical, and scientific implications of the Big Bang. He has also authored articles on Islam and
    Evolution, and Islam and Extraterrestrial life.</p>
