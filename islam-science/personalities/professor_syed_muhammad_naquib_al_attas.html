<p>Professor Syed Muhammad Naquib Al-Attas was born in Bogor, West Java. He received his early education in Sukabumi and
    Johor Bahru. He later studied at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, England and, subsequently, at the University
    of Malaya, McGill University (MA) and the University of London (PhD), focusing on Islamic philosophy, theology and
    metaphysics. Tan Sri Syed Naquib has written over 30 books in the fields of Islamic philosophy, theology and
    metaphysics, history, literature, art and civilization, and religion and education. He is among the few contemporary
    scholars who is also thoroughly rooted in the traditional Islamic sciences. His magnum opus is <em>Prolegomena to
        the Metaphysics of Islam</em> and his latest book (2023) is <em>IslƒÅm: The Covenants Fulfilled</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a scholar of Islam, Tan Sri Syed Naquib has made significant contributions to the contemporary world of Islam in
    the domains of the Islamization of contemporary knowledge and of Muslim education. He was responsible for the
    conceptualization of the Islamic University, which he initially formulated at the First World Conference on Muslim
    Education, held in Makkah (1979). In 1987, Tan Sri Syed Naquib founded and directed the International Institute of
    Islamic Thought and Civilization (ISTAC), which is a major, global academic institution.</p>
