<p class="h2 text-center py-4">WHY ISLAM IS TRUE</p>
<p>Islam can be summarized in three basic points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Belief in God (Allah) &ndash; To believe in His existence, His Oneness, and all His other Attributes.</li>
<li>Belief in Muhammad ﷺ as God&rsquo;s Prophet &ndash; To believe that Muhammad ﷺ was sent by God and to believe in all the teachings he brought to us from God.</li>
<li>Belief in Afterlife &ndash;To believe in all that has been taught by God&rsquo;s Prophet regarding the afterlife.</li>
</ol>
<p>Classical books of Islamic Theology demonstrate the truth of Islam by providing proofs for all these three parts in order. The first section of classical books deals with rational proofs for God&rsquo;s existence and His Attributes. The second section of these books deals with proofs that show that Muhammad ﷺ is indeed God&rsquo;s Prophet. Here the rational possibility of Prophetic miracles and their implications are first explained based on the fact that God (Allah) exists. Then specific miracles of Muhammad ﷺ are provided which prove that he is God&rsquo;s Prophet. The miracles of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ include the miracle of the Qur&rsquo;an and other physical miracles. The third and final section of these books demonstrates the rational possibility of an Afterlife and describes aspects of the Afterlife that have been taught by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. For this section, scriptural proofs are provided from Islamic scriptural sources as the validity of the Prophet&rsquo;s teachings is already proved in the second section.</p>
<p>Classical books of Islamic Theology are taught all over world in traditional Islamic Seminaries (<em>Madrassas</em>). Online courses that teach these books are also available today. Shaykh Hamza Karmali has built an online course that teaches these proofs in a simple and interactive manner. His course is named Why Islam Is True and is an excellent resource for individuals studying this topic for the first time. Why Islam Is True course is available on the website whyislamistrue.com (<a href="https://whyislamistrue.com/">https://whyislamistrue.com/</a>).</p>
