<p>Scientism is the philosophical stance that science is the ultimate authority on all questions, extending its methods
    and principles beyond natural phenomena to areas addressed by the humanities, ethics, metaphysics, and religion.
    While science excels at finding correlations in the physical world and driving technological advancement,
    scientism's overreach leads to an unfounded dismissal of moral values, non-physical experiences, and religious
    practices. Scientism attempts to reduce complex human realities to empirical data and disregards the insights
    provided by philosophy, theology, and spirituality. This reductionist approach fosters an overly mechanistic
    worldview, limited to materialistic explanations. By failing to recognize the limits of science, scientism
    undermines its own credibility and neglects the importance of interdisciplinary dialogue.</p>
<br />
<p>Dr. Rik Peels classifies scientism into weak scientism and strong scientism. He explains weak scientism as:
    &ldquo;Weak scientism says that only science provides knowledge in a particular realm of life. Examples are
    metaphysical intuition, introspection and morality.&rdquo; He explains strong scientism as: &ldquo;Strong (rather
    than weak) scientism says that only science provides knowledge in any realm, including all the above realms. That is
    also how the American philosopher of science Massimo Pigliucci understands the term &lsquo;scientism&rsquo;: it is
    &lsquo;a totalizing attitude that regards science as the ultimate standard and arbiter of all interesting questions;
    or alternatively that seeks to expand the very definition and scope of science to encompass all aspects of human
    knowledge and understanding&rsquo;. One might think that this is an absurd view that no one accepts. But several
    scientists and philosophers call themselves adherents of scientism and explicitly embrace this view.&rdquo;</p>
<br />
    <p>Prof. Austin L. Hughes writes: &ldquo;Advocates of scientism today claim the sole mantle of rationality, frequently
    equating science with reason itself. Yet it seems the very antithesis of reason to insist that science can do what
    it cannot, or even that it has done what it demonstrably has not. As a scientist, I would never deny that scientific
    discoveries can have important implications for metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, and that everyone interested
    in these topics needs to be scientifically literate. But the claim that science and science alone can answer
    longstanding questions in these fields gives rise to countless problems.&rdquo;</p>
    <br />
    <p>The way science is presented in many popular science writings and videos has led to the spread of scientism among the
    general public. Studying philosophy of science can help a lot in countering such false notions. It can be hoped that
    there will be more focus on the philosophy of science in the future, which will help in spreading a proper
    understanding of science among the general public.</p>
