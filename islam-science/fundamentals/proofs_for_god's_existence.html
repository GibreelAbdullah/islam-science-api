<p class="h2 text-center py-4">PROOF FOR GOD'S EXISTENCE</p>
<p>Classical Islamic Theologians have explained two rational proofs for the existence of God. These are:</p>
<br />
<strong>Proof 1: The Contingency Argument</strong> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It can be written in simple deductive logic format as: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Minor premise</strong>: The universe exists Contingently.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Major Premise</strong>: Anything that exists Contingently needs a Necessary Being
    to make it the way that it is.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The universe needs a Necessary Being to make it the way that
    it is. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are several online resources that explain the Contingency Argument, including: </p>

<br />
<strong>Proof 2: The Kalam Cosmological Argument</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It can be written in of simple deductive logic format as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Minor premise</strong>: The universe began to exist.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Major Premise</strong>: Everything that began to exist was made to exist by
    something that did not begin to exist.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The universe was made to exist by something that did not
    begin to exist. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are several online resources that explain the Kalam Cosmological Argument,
    including: </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&bull;&nbsp;Explanation by Shaykh Hamza Karmali, <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/2lxdo3eBmmw?si=jrtxRGfIEzcb3-Z_">Part

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&bull;&nbsp;Shaykh Hamza Karmali, <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/detcZKfEc7U?si=q_LO4YuREaB_mpwL">All God's Prophets
        Made the Kalam Cosmological Argument</a><br /></p><br />The above proofs remain valid irrespective of
developments in science or other knowledge domains, as these proofs are based only on basic rationality and logic.
Anyone who thinks rationally necessarily arrives at these conclusions.</p>
<br />
<p>The above proof shows that a Necessary Being exists. Classical Islamic Theologians provide a list of 13 important
    Attributes for the Necessary Being: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Existence</li>
    <li>Not Beginning</li>
    <li>Not Ending</li>
    <li>Self-subsistence, meaning not needing any place or determinant to exist.</li>
    <li>Dissimilarity to Created Things</li>
    <li>Uniqueness, meaning having no partner (sharik) in His entity, attributes, or actions. </li>
    <li>Omnipotent Power</li>
    <li>Will </li>
    <li>Knowledge</li>
    <li>Life</li>
    <li>Hearing</li>
    <li>Sight</li>
    <li>Speech</li>
</ol>
<br />
<p>Classical Islamic Theologians also provide the proofs for all these Attributes. The proof for existence is the
    Contingency Argument and Kalam Cosmological Argument mentioned above. The proofs for other attributes are included
    in classical books of Islamic Theology and are taught all over the world in Islamic Seminaries (<em>Madrassas</em>).

<p>Shaykh Hamza Karmali explains the proofs for all these 13 Attributes in his simple and interactive online course
    named <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://whyislamistrue.com/">Why Islam Is True</a>
</p>
<br />
Other online resources are also available where these proofs are taught as a part of courses on Islamic
Theology.

<br />
<p> The Necessary Being with these 13 Attributes is God (or Allah) in Islam.
