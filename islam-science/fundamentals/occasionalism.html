<p class="h2 text-center py-4">OCCASIONALISM</p>
<p>Occasionalism is the doctrine that God is the sole immediate cause of all events, to the exclusion of any causal participation on the part of creatures. No created object can cause (or create) an effect and there is no necessity for certain cause-effect pairs to always occur together. God creates the cause and God creates the effect and He can create them in whichever way He likes. Fire does not cause the burning. Both the fire and the burning are created separately by Allah. It is perfectly possible for God to create fire and cooling together instead (as it was in the case of Ibrahim a.s.). The concept of occasionalism is part of Ash&rsquo;ari Theology and is taught widely in Islamic Seminaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of occasionalism is highly useful in discussions on Islam and Science. Occasionalism can easily demonstrate that God is directly involved in causing all physical phenomena. Although scientific theories can be used to understand correlations between different phenomena, occasionalism shows that it is God who is the direct and only cause of these physical phenomena.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunni Kalam scholars famously utilized the concept of occasionalism in their debates with the Falasifa on natural phenomena. The Falasifa adopted certain positions based on Greek philosophy which contradicted Islamic beliefs. The <em>Mutakallimun</em> (scholars of Kalam) used the concept of occasionalism to demonstrate that the Falasifa are mistaken in their claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imam Ghazali mentions in his famous book <em>Tahafut-ul-Falasifah</em>, regarding the occasionalist doctrine:&nbsp; "The connection between what is habitually believed to be a cause and what is habitually believed to be an effect is not necessary," Imam Ghazali writes: &ldquo;Take for instance any two things, such as the quenching of thirst and drinking ; satisfaction of hunger and eating ; burning and contact with fire ; light and the rise of the Sun ; death and the severance of the head from the trunk ; healing and the use of medicine ; the loosening of bowels and the use of a purgative, or any other set of events observed to be connected together in Medicine, or Astronomy, or Arts, or Crafts. They are connected as the result of the Decree of God (holy be His name), which preceded their existence. If one follows the other, it is because He has created them in that fashion, not because the connection in itself is necessary and indissoluble. He has the power to create the satisfaction of hunger without eating, or death without the severance of the head, or even the survival of life when the head has been cut off, or any other thing from among the connected things (independently of what is supposed to be its cause).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imam Ghazali further discusses occasionalism through his famous example of fire and cotton: &ldquo;let us consider only one example&mdash;viz., the burning of a piece of cotton at the time of its contact with fire. We admit the possibility of a contact between the two which will not result in burning, as also we admit the possibility of the transformation of cotton into ashes without coming into contact with fire. And they reject this possibility.</p>
<p>There are three points from which the discussion of the question can be started:</p>
<p>Firstly, the opponent may claim that fire alone is the agent of burning, and that being an agent by nature (not by choice), it cannot refrain from doing what it is its nature to do&mdash;after it comes into contact with a subject which is receptive to it. This is what we deny. We say that it is God who&mdash;through the intermediacy of angels, or directly&mdash;is the agent of the creation of blackness in cotton; of the disintegration of its parts, and of their transformation into a smouldering heap or ashes. Fire, which is an inanimate thing, has no action. How can one prove that it is an agent? The only argument is from the observation of the fact of burning at the time of contact with fire. But observation only shows that one is with the other, not that it is by it and has no other cause than it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of occasionalism is mentioned in most of the later works of Islamic theology. Imam Ahmad al-Dardir mentions in Al-Kharida al-Bahiyya which is a poetic work on Islamic Theology:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;And then know that effecting is for none/But the Overpowering One</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Asserting that things effect by their/Nature or by necessity is disbelief according to the religion</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And affirming that thing effect by God-given power/Is sinful innovation, so pay no attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Khalq and Kasb</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of Khalq and Kasb is part of Ash&rsquo;ari theology. It is discussed in the context of human free will. The concept of Khalq and Kasb shows that humans have the free will to choose their actions, while it is God who actually creates these human actions. So, God is the creator of all things including human actions, while humans acquire these actions (Kasb) through their choice or intention to do them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of Khalq and Kasb helps in reconciling the fact that God is the creator of all things, with the fact that humans have free will.</p>
