<p class="h2 text-center py-4">CAN TECHNOLOGY FIX ITS OWN NEGATIVE EFFECTS?</p>
<p>There is a widespread belief that better technologies can solve issues caused by current technologies. Often the society is urged based on this notion to focus more on technological development as a solution to current problems like pollution, climate change, etc. This notion is often pushed by institutions, corporates, and even nations and international organizations. However, there is an absolute lack of clarity regarding the truth and validity of this notion. Michael Huesemann and Joyce Huesemann question the truth of this notion in their book is titled <em>Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won't Save Us Or the Environment</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Techno-Fix publisher&rsquo;s summary:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Techno-Fix questions a primary paradigm of our age: that advanced technology will extricate us from an ever increasing load of social, environmental, and economic ills. Techno-Fix shows why negative unintended consequences of science and technology are inherently unavoidable and unpredictable, why counter-technologies, techno-fixes, and efficiency improvements do not offer lasting solutions, and why modern technology, in the presence of continued economic growth, does not promote sustainability but instead hastens collapse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authors explore the reasons for the uncritical acceptance of new technologies; show that technological optimism is based on ignorance and that increasing consumerism and materialism, which have been facilitated by science and technology, have failed to increase happiness. The common belief that technological change is inevitable is questioned, the myth of the value-neutrality of technology is exposed and the ethics of the technological imperative: "what can be done should be done" is challenged. Techno-Fix asserts that science and technology, as currently practiced, cannot solve the many serious problems we face and that a paradigm shift is needed to reorient science and technology in a more socially responsible and environmentally sustainable direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authors of Techno-Fix are inside observers of the technological scene.&nbsp; Educated and experienced in science and engineering, the authors deliver a highly readable, insightful and powerful critique of modern technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The readers of Techno-Fix will learn a number of inconvenient truths about science and technology, topics that are rarely, if ever, covered in the media or discussed among professionals. Readers will be challenged to re-examine their current worldview, their paradigms and assumptions about the so-called promises of modern technology. But they will also feel empowered and inspired by the fact that most problems confronting humanity have inherently simple, low-tech solutions&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Inquisitive Biologist Review:</strong></p>
<p>The Inquisitive Biologist website provides a detailed review of Techno-Fix. Their review mentions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, new technology can fix the problems old technology created? To the Huesemanns, counter-technologies such as geo-engineering schemes are like handing you another spade as you are digging your own grave&mdash;they come with their own unintended consequences. Furthermore, they write, efficiency gains (e.g. dematerialisation) have their limits and are often followed by increased consumption, a phenomenon known as the Jevons paradox. Ironically, despite increased affluence in the developed world, psychological research shows that happiness and well-being have not increased. Instead, we are stuck on a hedonic treadmill, furiously desiring ever more. The profit motive behind most technological developments results in solutions that benefit corporations and their shareholders, not the public at large.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since these drawbacks are known, why does the belief in technological progress persist? The authors draw parallels between religious faith and techno-optimism, with the latter rising as the former waned. Furthermore, seemingly objective practices such as risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses are skewed towards continued technological development, downplaying or neglecting externalized costs. Finally, they take serious issue with the uncritical acceptance of new technologies due to the widespread belief that progress is inevitable and that technology is value-neutral, i.e. just a tool that can be used for good or evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Techno-Fix is insightful regarding the issues of blind pursuit of technological progress. However, the solutions that the book offers may not be fully practical. Reviewers have pointed out issues with the solutions presented in the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>John Admas &ldquo;Can technology save us?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The abstract of John Adams work <em>Can technology save us?</em> goes as follows: &ldquo;Assume there is incredible technological progress in endeavours to solve problems of energy scarcity, pollution and congestion; imagine a super Super Car powered by a pollution-free perpetual motion engine; imagine a super Internet which provides free and efficient access to all the databases and libraries in the world. The result would be a social and environmental disaster - unless at the same time humankind manages to curb the appetites which are driving the steeply rising growth curves of material consumption and physical and electronic mobility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His argument here is that the technological enterprises that are currently consuming the lion's share of resources directed to the solution of transport problems are relaxing important constraints on these appetites. This would then lead to more serious issues, rather than solving it. His abstract concludes that the principal barrier to a morally and politically sustainable transport policy is the belief that there are technical solutions for these problems. Although this work focuses only on the transportation sector, perhaps their conclusion is also applicable to all other sectors in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often studies in the above line are rare. However, the above two publications seem to provide a very strong argument.</p>
