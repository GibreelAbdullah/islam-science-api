<p class="h2 text-center py-4">LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE</p>
<p>Although science is a powerful tool for understanding the correlations between natural phenomena, it has its own limitations. Inductive logic forms the backbone of the scientific method, where general conclusions are drawn from specific observations. Several limitations stem from the inherent uncertainties and philosophical issues associated with inductive reasoning. Other limitations arise due to the fact that science only deals with tangible material phenomena. Topics like ethics lie outside the domain of science, and science cannot comment on such topics. Here is a list of some key limitations associated with science:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Problem of Induction</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>First highlighted by philosopher David Hume, the "problem of induction" highlights that conclusions drawn from inductive reasoning can never be guaranteed to be true. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observing that the sun has risen every day in recorded history leads to the conclusion that it will rise tomorrow. However, this conclusion is not absolutely certain; it is based on the assumption that the future will resemble the past.</li>
</ul>
<p>This inherent uncertainty means scientific conclusions are provisional, and always subject to revision with new evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Only Deals with Observable and Measurable </strong><strong>Physical Phenomena</strong><strong>; Cannot Address Subjective</strong><strong>, Moral, or </strong><strong>Metaphysical Questions</strong><strong>. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Science only deals with tangible and observable physical phenomena. The scientific method relies on measurable data from physical phenomena. Hence, science cannot study phenomena that are purely subjective or metaphysical. Science cannot be used to answer questions about God, morality, ethics, or the meaning of life. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can study the effects of an action, but it cannot determine whether the action is right or wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Bound by the Current State of Knowledge</strong><strong> &amp; Cannot Provide Absolute Certainty</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Scientific understanding is limited by the tools, techniques, and theories available at any given time. As a result, it is always incomplete and subject to change as new discoveries are made. They are open to revision if new evidence emerges, meaning science cannot offer absolute truths. Scientific theories can be upended by paradigm shifts, as described by philosopher Thomas Kuhn. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The theory of phlogiston, popularly adopted in the 17th century, held that a fire-like element called "phlogiston" was released during combustion. This idea was eventually disproven by Antoine Lavoisier's discovery of oxygen and the modern understanding of oxidation.</li>
<li>Newtonian mechanics was long considered universally valid, but the development of quantum mechanics and relativity revealed that it is not. The frameworks of quantum mechanics and relativity have since replaced Newtonian mechanics.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Inability to Guarantee Universality</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Even with extensive evidence, inductive conclusions can only assert probabilities, not absolute certainties. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observing that all swans in a region are white may lead to the conclusion that "all swans are white." However, the discovery of black swans invalidates this generalization.<br /> Science, therefore, operates within the bounds of probability, always leaving room for exceptions or anomalies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Influenced by Human Bias</strong><strong> &amp; Resource Limitations</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Despite efforts to remain objective, science can be influenced by cultural, social, or personal biases, which can affect research priorities, interpretation of data, and communication of findings. Confirmation bias is a challenge in science, where researchers may focus on evidence that supports their hypothesis while ignoring contradictory data. Research is also constrained by funding, technology, and time, which can limit the scope and depth of scientific studies. Funding bodies influence the type of research done, which can lead to focus on specific areas only or on specific theories only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By understanding these limitations, we can better appreciate the scope of science and recognize the importance of integrating it with other disciplines like philosophy, theology, and metaphysics to address the broader questions of God, human existence, and the meaning of life.</p>

<p>Modern-day Muslim Philosopher Hasan Spiker highlighted the need for a philosophically informed wholesome understanding of modern science. Hasan Spiker writes regarding certain limitations in science and the way it is understood by the general public: &ldquo;The reality of modern science is that far from being "neutral", it is so geared towards instrumentality, adapting means to ends, and technology, that the best philosophers of science frequently opine that it does not in fact study the "nature" of the physical world at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also writes: &ldquo;The word &ldquo;science&rdquo; has been commandeered and expropriated by &ldquo;modern science&rdquo; only quite recently; until the end of the 19th century, it was &ldquo;natural philosophy&rdquo; and thus a branch of science still (at least nominally) continuous with metaphysics. The Latin *scientia* referred most fundamentally to demonstrative knowledge, with metaphysics being the most &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; of the sciences because of the unequivocal nature of its principles and conclusions, its foundationality to the other sciences, and its irreducibility to any other sciences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hasan Spiker goes further: &ldquo;Another pressing reason making a healthy (informed) scepticism about &ldquo;science&rdquo;, well, healthy, is the massive disconnect between popular false concretizations of scientific theories amongst consumers of &ldquo;popular science&rdquo;, on the one hand and the actual highly tentative or even strictly groundless nature of the theories themselves, on the other. Theories which are often little more than elaborate mathematical models enjoying literally zero empirical corroboration after forty years of research (string theory), or even, no empirical corroboration even in principle (multiverse theory) whereas widespread popular conviction (richly imaginative but ultimately fantasy) holds these multiple dimensions to be actual entities. This doesn't seem to bother most scientists too much!.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He writes: &ldquo;Another is the popular assumption that what philosophers of science call &ldquo;theoretical entities&rdquo; and &ldquo;unobservable entities&rdquo;, such as quarks, electrons (which are detected, but not observed, in cloud chambers), and even atoms, straightforwardly exist, rather than constituting exigencies of explanation and coherence. But in fact, the existence of these entities and others is the subject of vigorous debate between scientific realists and anti-realists. The latter particularly point to the underdetermination of theories by observational data, which means the data could in fact be explained by numerous other theories. This is partly because of the unobservability of many of the theoretical entities posited by the theory, implying that they could in principle be replaced by alternative theoretical &ldquo;entities&rdquo;. Proponents of this view, such as Larry Laudan in his &ldquo;A Confutation of Convergent Realism&rdquo;, especially point to the empirical SUCCESS of theories, employing unobservable entities such as &ldquo;phlogiston&rdquo; , which scientific consensus now deems entirely fictional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hasan spiker writes: &ldquo;We urgently need to begin to transform our contemporary conceptions of theʿulūm and what it means to be an ʿālim in order to counteract this bifurcated, unintegrated vision of reality; the &lsquo;ulama&rsquo; must as a standard study the modern natural science, understand their philosophical presuppositions and implications, and be able to make the distinction between instrumentally-geared "model", on the one hand, and extramental reality, on the other; it should also become widely known that many and really most modern scientists can't tell the difference, because of their lack of philosophical training; they do not fully understand the real demarcation of the domain in which they are themselves working. As a result, much (not all), modern science really is, speaking frankly, the glorified hocus pocus of a materialist cult, stewarded and guarded by an initiated priestly class who send down their pronouncements to "follow the Science" to the fervent ʿawāmm masses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hasan Spiker in the above passages highlights the need for people to gain a proper and wholesome understanding of science, including the knowledge of its philosophical underpinnings, limitations, and possible cases of misrepresentation. Further work needs to be done in this regard, as there are very few publications on this topic. A wholesome understanding of science will help Muslims and all of humanity.</p>
