<p><a name="_Toc188884318"></a><a name="_Toc188884523"></a><a name="_Toc188884624"></a>It is observed that the recent rapid technological progress has caused a wide variety of issues, from environmental damage, to corporate overreach, and mental health problems. It is vital to understand the negative effects of technology so that technological development can be conducted in a way that minimizes these harms. Below are some of the major negative impacts of technology:</p>

<li><a name="_Toc188884319"></a><a name="_Toc188884524"></a><a name="_Toc188884625"></a> <strong>Pollution &amp; Environmental Degradation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a name="_Toc188884320"></a><a name="_Toc188884525"></a><a name="_Toc188884626"></a>Rapid technological progress has significantly contributed to pollution and environmental degradation, impacting ecosystems worldwide. The industrial processes involved in manufacturing and production release vast quantities of pollutants into the air, water, and soil, leading to smog, acid rain, and contamination of ecosystems. The release of greenhouse gases and particulate matter has significantly contributed to climate change and deteriorating air quality. The extraction of raw materials for technological and industrial purposes, such as mining for metals and fossil fuels, destroys natural habitats, leads to deforestation, and depletes finite resources, threatening biodiversity by disrupting ecosystems and driving species extinction. Furthermore, improper disposal of industrial and technological waste contaminates waterways, harms wildlife, and endangers human health. This unchecked cycle of technological progress is causing irreversible damage to the planet.</p>

</ol>
<p><a name="_Toc188884322"></a><a name="_Toc188884527"></a><a name="_Toc188884628"></a>Technology has enabled the rise of a few tech corporations that are increasingly controlling most of the market. This kind of dominance causes issues like: suppression of smaller competitors, exploitation of labor in developing countries, personal data collected by tech companies is used for targeted advertising and manipulation, and planned obsolescence: companies design products with a short lifespan to encourage frequent upgrades. Tech giants often prioritize profit over sustainability which prevents the development of sustainable alternatives. These corporations sometimes become so powerful that they also exert control over countries.</p>

<li><a name="_Toc188884323"></a><a name="_Toc188884528"></a><a name="_Toc188884629"></a> <strong>Social Isolation and Reduced Interpersonal Skills</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a name="_Toc188884324"></a><a name="_Toc188884529"></a><a name="_Toc188884630"></a>Overuse of technology limits face-to-face interactions, replacing them with virtual communication. This leads to increased loneliness, weaker emotional bonds, and decline in interpersonal and emotional intelligence.</p>

</ol>
<p><a name="_Toc188884326"></a><a name="_Toc188884531"></a><a name="_Toc188884632"></a>Social media and excessive screen time are linked to stress, anxiety, and depression. Social media comparisons lead to low self-esteem. Cyberbullying and digital addiction exacerbate mental health challenges.</p>

</ol>
<p><a name="_Toc188884328"></a><a name="_Toc188884533"></a><a name="_Toc188884634"></a>Prolonged screen time and inactivity from tech use lead to health concerns like vision problems, obesity and musculoskeletal issues due to sedentary lifestyles. The use of pesticides in crops, preservatives, and food additives can cause health problems in the long term. Although better farming technologies have contributed to the widespread availability of food items, there are serious concerns regarding deterioration in food quality.</p>
