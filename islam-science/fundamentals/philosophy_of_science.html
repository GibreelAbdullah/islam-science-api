<p class="h2 text-center py-4">PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE</p>
<p>Philosophy of science is the field that examines foundational principles, methods, and implications of scientific inquiry. It explores questions about what distinguishes science from other forms of knowledge, the nature of scientific reasoning, and the reliability of scientific conclusions. It examines the role of observation and theory, and debates on realism versus anti-realism. Discussions on realism versus anti-realism question whether scientific theories represent the reality or are only just tools useful for prediction. Philosophers like Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn have emphasized on ideas like falsifiability and paradigm shifts, which show the nature of scientific knowledge and how science changes with time. Discussion on the limits of objectivity and bias in scientific practice is also a part of this field. Ethical and societal impact of science, examining the responsibilities of scientists, the impact of scientific advancements on humanity, and the potential for misuse of scientific discoveries. The field often intersects with other philosophical areas, such as metaphysics, ethics, and logic.</p>

<p>Although there have been discussions on some aspects of the philosophy of science from the Islamic perspective, there are no comprehensive published works that deal with the entire field for the modern context. Currently available books on the philosophy of science deal with the topic based on the way that Western philosophers approached it. Professor Samir Okasha&rsquo;s book <em>Philosophy of Science: Very Short Introduction</em>em>  provides an introduction to the main themes and theories of contemporary philosophy of science. The book consists of the following chapters:</p>

<p>Philosophy of science is crucial for understanding the true nature and scope of science, yet it is often overlooked in modern scientific training. Many scientists today receive little to no exposure to the philosophical foundations of their work, which often leads to significant issues in how they understand science and use it. Philosophy of science is rarely taught in schools or universities, and most students of science are unaware of the discussions in this field. This gap often perpetuates a narrow, overly reductionist view of science, ignoring the interplay between theory, evidence, and interpretation. Often scientists and students of science try to extend science to topics that lie outside the domain of science. Such attempts lead them to false conclusions on those topics. Scientific theories are often spread as dogmatic beliefs by certain media and institutions, overlooking the true nature of scientific enquiry. Such issues highlight the importance of philosophy of science. The integration of philosophy of science into scientific education is a must for facilitating true understanding of science, the true role of science, and the limits of scientific knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Islamic Perspective</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor Syed Naquib Al-Attas&rsquo;s chapter on Islam and the Philosophy of Science, in his famous book titled &lsquo;Prolegomena to the Metaphysics of Islam&rsquo;, attempts to address certain issues related to the philosophy of science from the Islamic perspective. This chapter is a good source for knowing more about recent attempts to build an Islamic approach to Philosophy of science. Syed Naquib Al-Attas writes: &ldquo;Contemporary science has evolved and developed out of a philosophy that since its earliest periods affirmed the coming into being of things out of each other. Everything existent is a progression, a development or evolution of what lies in latency in eternal matter. The world seen from this perspective is an independent, eternal universe; a selfsubsistent system evolving according to its own laws. The denial of the reality and existence of God is already implied in this philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He writes: &ldquo;Based upon the position established by our philosophical and scientific tradition as integrated into a coherent metaphysical system, we maintain that many important similarities are found between our position and that of modern, contemporary philosophy and science&hellip;..But these similarities are apparent and pertain only to their external aspects, and they do not negate the profound differences that arise from our divergent worldviews and beliefs about the ultimate nature of Reality. Our affirmation of Revelation as the source of knowledge of ultimate reality and truth pertaining both to created things as well as to their Creator provides us with the foundation for a metaphysical framework in which to elaborate our philosophy of science as an integrated system descriptive of that reality and truth in a way which is not open to the methods of the secular philosophic rationalism and philosophic empiricism of modern philosophy and science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is still a pressing need for further works in this field for further developing the discourse on Islam &amp; Philosophy of Science.</p>
