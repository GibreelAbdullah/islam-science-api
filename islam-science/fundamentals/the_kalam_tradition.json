    "data":"<p>The Kalam tradition in Islam is a rich intellectual tradition that deals with rational proofs for Islamic beliefs. Although there is a great degree of overlap between the two, <em>Ilmul Kalam</em> differs from <em>Aqida</em> in that <em>Aqida</em> deals merely states the points of Islamic beliefs while <em>Ilmul Kalam </em>seeks to establish and defend these beliefs through rational arguments. Shaykh Nuh Keller writes: &ldquo;In short, Islamic kalam theology exists because belief in Islam demands three things:</p><ol><li>to define the contents of faith;</li><li>to show that it is possible for the mind to accept, not absurd or inconsistent;</li><li>and to give reasons to be personally convinced of it.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>Historically, Kalam emerged among Sunni Muslims due to the need to defend Sunni Aqida from attacks by heretical groups like the Mu&rsquo;tazila. There are two schools of Sunni Kalam: the Ash&rsquo;ari school founded by Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash&rsquo;ari, and the Maturidi school founded by Imam Abu Mansoor al-Maturidi.</p><p>The Kalam tradition played a vital role in defending Islam against internal and external critiques. As the Islam expanded, Muslims encountered diverse philosophical and theological systems, including Greek philosophy, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity. Kalam scholars engaged in rigorous debates with these traditions, articulating Islamic tenets and demonstrating their validity through rational arguments. The Kalam tradition successfully defended Sunni beliefs from the attacks of Muslim groups like the Mu&rsquo;tazila and the Falasifa (A group of early Muslim Philosophers). Groups like the Mu&rsquo;tazila and the Falasifa adopted certain non-Islamic points of belief due to the influence of Greek philosophy. Sunni Kalam scholars produced brilliant works in response, demonstrating that these non-Islamic beliefs are invalid both rationally and scripturally.</p>"
