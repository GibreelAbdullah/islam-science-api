    "data":"<p>Occasionalism is the doctrine that God is the sole immediate cause of all events, to the exclusion of any causal participation on the part of creatures. No created object can cause (or create) an effect and there is no necessity for certain cause-effect pairs to always occur together. God creates the cause and God creates the effect and He can create them in whichever way He likes. Fire does not cause the burning. Both the fire and the burning are created separately by Allah. It is perfectly possible for God to create fire and cooling together instead (as it was in the case of Ibrahim a.s.). The concept of occasionalism is part of Ash&rsquo;ari Theology and is taught widely in Islamic Seminaries.</p>"
