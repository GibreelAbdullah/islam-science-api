<p class="h2 text-center py-4">BASICS OF ISLAM: STUDY RESOURCES</p>
<p>A basic study of Islam is necessary for understanding current discussions on Islam,
  Science, and Technology. For Muslims, the study of the basics of Islam is also personally obligatory on religious
  grounds. The efforts of classical Islamic Scholars have led to the development of various distinct disciplines
  within the Islamic knowledge tradition. Some of the main disciplines are: Fiqh (Sacred Law), Tafsir (Quranic
  Interpretation), Hadith (Prophetic Narrations), Aqida (Islamic Theology), and Tasawwuf (Islamic Spirituality or
  Sufism).
</p>
<br />
<p>For Sunni Muslims, who form the majority of Muslims, there are four schools of Fiqh
  (Islamic Sacred Law). These are: Hanafi, Shafi&rsquo;i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools, named after their original
  founders. In Aqida (Islamic Theology) the Ash&rsquo;ari, Matureedi, and Hanbali schools represent the beliefs of the Sunni majority. The differences between these three schools of Aqida are only in
  matters of terminology or minor secondary points of belief. Ash&rsquo;ari and Matureedi schools have historically
  played a great role in defending Islamic beliefs through rational arguments. Hence, these two are more widely known
  and studied. Although Tasawwuf (Islamic Spirituality or Sufism) also has classical books on the subject, it is of a
  more practical nature compared to other disciplines. True Islamic spirituality or true Sufism is distinct from fake
  versions in the strong emphasis that it gives in adhering to Islamic law and beliefs as specified by the above
  schools of Fiqh and Aqida. </p>
<br />
<p>Although offline study is always recommended for Islamic knowledge, online resources
  are also available today. Online resources are useful in cases where offline study is not possible. Some online
  resources are listed below: </p>
