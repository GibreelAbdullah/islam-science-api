<p class="h2 text-center py-4">THE KALAM TRADITION</p>
<p>The Kalam tradition in Islam is a rich intellectual tradition that deals with rational proofs for Islamic beliefs. Although there is a great degree of overlap between the two, <em>Ilmul Kalam</em> differs from <em>Aqida</em> in that <em>Aqida</em> merely states the points of Islamic beliefs while <em>Ilmul Kalam </em>seeks to establish and defend these beliefs through rational arguments. Shaykh Nuh Keller writes: &ldquo;In short, Islamic kalam theology exists because belief in Islam demands three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>to define the contents of faith;</li>
<li>to show that it is possible for the mind to accept, not absurd or inconsistent;</li>
<li>and to give reasons to be personally convinced of it.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, Kalam emerged among Sunni Muslims due to the need to defend Sunni Aqida from attacks by heretical groups like the Mu&rsquo;tazila. There are two schools of Sunni Kalam: the Ash&rsquo;ari school founded by Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash&rsquo;ari, and the Maturidi school founded by Imam Abu Mansoor al-Maturidi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kalam tradition played a vital role in defending Islam against internal and external critiques. As the Islam expanded, Muslims encountered diverse philosophical and theological systems, including Greek philosophy, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity. Kalam scholars engaged in rigorous debates with these traditions, articulating Islamic tenets and demonstrating their validity through rational arguments. The Kalam tradition successfully defended Sunni beliefs from the attacks of Muslim groups like the Mu&rsquo;tazila and the Falasifa (A group of early Muslim Philosophers). Groups like the Mu&rsquo;tazila and the Falasifa adopted certain non-Islamic points of belief due to the influence of Greek philosophy. Sunni Kalam scholars produced brilliant works in response, demonstrating that these non-Islamic beliefs are invalid both rationally and scripturally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kalam tradition is highly relevant today due to the need to defend Islamic beliefs from the attacks of modern-day atheists and materialist philosophies. Shaykh Nuh Keller writes: &ldquo;As for the role of kalam in defending Islam from heresies, Jahm and the Mu&lsquo;tazilites are certainly less of threat to orthodoxy today than scientism, the reduction of all truth to statements about quantities and empirical facts. The real challenge to religion today is the mythic power of science to theologize its experimental method, and imply that since it has not discovered God, He must not exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article &lsquo;The Importance of Kalam and the Revival of Theological Discourse&rsquo; on Kalam Research and Media website mentions: &ldquo;Today, the developments in the various fields of human and natural sciences and in the arts call for an urgent and serious engagement by Muslims. The only way this will be possible is through a revival of the Kalam tradition, though broadened to incorporate a much wider theological enterprise than previously that can once again make sense of the world we live in and which also bridges the gap between being and existence, thought and action, between learning centres and their communities. Issues related to evolution, ethics, pluralism, inter-faith, environment, quantum physics, etc, cannot be dealt with on purely legal terms, but must be engaged through a systematic theological, rational, spiritual, ethical and legal vantage point. If the idea of an Islamic civilization is to be rekindled, then all of its fundamental sciences, from theology to art, must also be revived. Without them we will simply not have the basic tools to probe the burning questions of the age. The theological enterprise is therefore an urgent one.&rdquo;</p>
