<p class="h2 text-center py-4">SPRITUALITY AS A SOLUTION</p>
<p>Rapid technological progress has caused various major issues like pollution, environmental damage, etc. Also, so far, the &lsquo;technological solution&rsquo; to these problems has failed. This leads us to think of other solutions outside the domain of technology. Can we consider spirituality as the solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance, perhaps it seems like a very na&iuml;ve suggestion. However, upon further inspection, it appears that spirituality indeed has a lot to offer. Islam has emphasized that the purpose of life is to worship Allah. The blind pursuit of material pleasures is discouraged strongly. Instead, individuals are encouraged to focus on Allah and the next world. These aspects are particularly emphasized in the discipline of Islamic spirituality, popularly known as Sufism. This aspect of Islam is also known as Tazkiya, Tasawwuf, and the science of Ihsan. Knowing, remembering, and worshipping Allah provides such satisfaction, contentment, and joy for Sufis that they have no need for material possessions, except in a minimal amount necessary for survival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thinking in this line, if a large section of the world population becomes realized Sufis who have no need for many material possessions, then automatically a lot of issues related to over-consumption might be solved. Lesser resources are required, and production activities can be cut down significantly. Also, in this case, there is no issue of people losing their happiness and quality of life due to a lack of material facilities. Sufis gain their joy and satisfaction through their relationship with Allah. Hence, material facilities are not a must for them to lead a happy and satisfying life. Also, it has been reported from realized Sufis that the joy and satisfaction that they gain in Knowing Allah (Ma&rsquo;rifa) is much greater than the joy that others gain from material pleasures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More work needs to be done focusing on this aspect. Perhaps the above notion can be crystalized into the general statement below. Further research can be performed to evaluate the truth and practicality of this statement:</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&ldquo;The ultimate solution for all over-consumption and technology related and issues is that people focus on spirituality rather than on material pleasures&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Focused academic studies in this regard are required to critically evaluate the truth of the above statement.</p>
