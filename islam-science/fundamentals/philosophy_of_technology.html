<p class="h2 text-center py-4">PHILOSOPHY OF TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>Philosophy of technology examines the nature, development, and consequences of technology in human life, focusing on how it shapes, and is shaped by, our understanding of the world. It explores fundamental questions such as: What is technology? How does it influence human thought, behavior, and society? At its core, the philosophy of technology investigates the interplay between technological artifacts, systems, and human values, acknowledging that technology is not merely a collection of tools but a cultural and intellectual force that transforms human experience. Thinkers in this field often analyze historical, ethical, and ontological dimensions of technology, questioning how it mediates our relationship with nature and each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One major theme in the philosophy of technology is the duality of its effects. On one hand, technology is seen as a positive force, enabling solutions to problems and enhancing human capabilities. On the other hand, it also leads to undesired consequences, such as pollution, environmental degradation, loss of privacy, and social inequalities. This duality prompts philosophers to address issues of responsibility and agency&mdash;asking whether technology is neutral or inherently value-laden, and who bears responsibility for its use or misuse. Another major theme is how technology redefines human identity, relationships, and values. Philosophy of technology seeks to understand and guide technology's impact on the human condition and the future of society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like the philosophy of science, philosophy of technology is not usually taught as it needs to be. As a result, there is a general lack of awareness regarding the importance of philosophy of technology. A lack of understanding of the philosophy of technology can lead to uncritical adoption of technological advancements, ignoring their ethical, social, and environmental implications. Without this awareness, societies risk exacerbating issues such as privacy violations, social inequality, and environmental degradation, as technology may be used without considering its long-term consequences. It can also result in a loss of human agency, as individuals fail to recognize how technology shapes their behavior and values. Furthermore, neglecting the philosophical dimensions of technology limits the ability to foresee and address potential risks, leading to a reactive rather than proactive approach to technological challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Islamic Perspective</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there have been works that explore certain aspects of philosophy of technology from Islamic perspective, there is still a need for works that evaluate the topic in-depth. Many published works focus on topics that fall within the domain of philosophy of technology, although they are not specifically written as works on philosophy of technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Edward Omar Moad&rsquo;s article titled <em>The technology of Happiness</em>em> discusses the following three interesting topics: a prospect of transhumanism and the current state of moral deliberation on technology, the conceptualization of technology in a principled way, the application of insights from Imam Ghazali&rsquo;s &lsquo;Alchemy of Happiness&rsquo; to evaluate the moral implications of technology. He writes: &ldquo;Returning to the topic with which we began, we may venture to say that, in what we might call Ghazali&rsquo;s philosophy of technology, there is, interestingly enough, something corresponding to the transhumanist, as well as the anarcho-primitivist perspective. Many, if not all, of the Prophets in history lived, at one time or another, in material conditions as simple and primitive as that of the hunter-gatherer idealized by the anarcho-primitivists. Even so, they were content with the satisfaction of only the most basic bodily necessities. Simultaneously, they attained a state that, in relation to the transhumanists&rsquo; comparably impoverished biological conception of humanity, we can fairly describe as transcending the very species. Of course, in relation to the Islamic conception of human nature, the Prophets simply embodied the utmost perfection of what the human being is and is meant to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Zara Khan&rsquo;s article <em>Taking Account of Tech: Fulfilling Our Personhood in the Smartphone Era</em>em> highlights some negative effects of technology on personal life and the importance of controlled use of devices like smartphones. She writes: &ldquo;Caution and wariness should be our approach to social media and smartphones. We must restrain these technologies in order to improve our physical and spiritual sight, liberate ourselves from internet addiction, improve the fulfillment of our mutual rights on one another and to the Earth, and quiet the ripples that smart technology sends through the water in our hearts, disturbing its stillness. God willing, that can lead us to cultivate&nbsp;<em>khushūʿ</em>&nbsp;within our hearts so that we can hope to be rightly guided.&nbsp;And Allah knows best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the guidelines provided by Islamic scholars regarding the use of technology may also help in shedding light on some aspects of Islamic view towards technology. Islamic scholars focused on Islamic spirituality often advise a controlled use of digital devices, highlighting their negative effects on spiritual life. Shaykh Nuh Keller writes in his article <em>Digital Social Media</em>em>: &ldquo;Social media, chat networks, motion pictures, computer games, and so forth reduce life to the size of a small screen. They directly reverse the effect of the remembrance of Allah, which is to expand the soul's horizons to the Divine. The less one has to do with them, the stronger one's dhikr will be. As 'Arif al-Yamani said, "Allah's turning away from a servant includes occupying him with what does not benefit him."</p>
<p>Yet media remain a two-edged sword. Communication may conduce to some good end, such as organizing others around a worthy common purpose - or it may simply be an opportunity for show and tell about one's nafs. The former is permitted in the spiritual path, though its benefit to the soul is often slender; while the latter should be shunned because it merely inflates the ego. As Sufis say, "Whatever is for Allah is connected, whatever is for other than Allah is dissevered."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a need for comprehensive books that address all topics falling within the domain philosophy of technology from the Islamic perspective. Such books will help in the development of a full-fledged Islamic approach to this field.</p>
