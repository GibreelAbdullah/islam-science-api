<p>The book &ldquo;Islamic Theology and Extraterrestrial Life: New Frontiers in Science and Religion&rdquo; was published in February 2024. The book is edited by Dr. Shoaib Ahmed Malik and Dr. J&ouml;rg Matthias Determann, and includes contributions from several authors. One very notable chapter in this book is written by famous Islamic Scholar and Theologian, Shaykh Hamza Karmali. Shaykh Hamza&rsquo;s chapter is titled &ldquo;Theological Information on the Existence of Intelligent Life Outside Our Solar System: Metaphysics, Scripture, and Science&rdquo;. He explores the question of extraterrestrial life based on classical Sunni Islamic scholarship. He shows that Sunni scholarly tradition explored the question of intelligent extraterrestrial life centuries before the age of science. He explains that the late Sunni tradition coalesced on several important conclusions that allow us to infer how it would have informed our scientific search for intelligent extraterrestrial life today. He concludes that theological information on extraterrestrial life leads us to the following two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is possible for extraterrestrial life to exist.</li>
<li>If extraterrestrial life does exist, then it has been less honored by God than human beings have been.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Hamza Karamali did an interview with Paul Williams on Blogging Theology where he discussed the contents of his paper. He mentions that although Angels are celestial beings and could be considered as extraterrestrial life, they are not the kind of extraterrestrial life that modern scientists are seeking to discover. Hence, he excluded Angels and Jinn from the discussion for the sake of better focus on the type of extraterrestrial life that modern scientists are searching for. Also, he clarified that the problem of salvation faced by Christians related to extraterrestrial life is not a problem for Muslims.&nbsp; He discussed the hadith on seven earths reported by Ibn Abbas (r.a.) which mentions other earths with intelligent life on them. However, the hadith is considered anomalous by Islamic Scholars. Hence, it cannot be used to authentically affirm the presence of intelligent extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, Shaykh Hamza discusses that human beings still retain the most special status even if intelligent extraterrestrial life exists. He shows that Quran 31:20 implies that God created the universe for human beings. He also brings other revelatory evidence to show that any extraterrestrial life would be less honored by God than human beings have been: the special creation of Adam (a.s.), Prostration of Angels to Adam (a.s.), and Scholarly consensus on the absolute specialness of Prophet Muhammed ï·º.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, Shaykh Hamza Karmali stated that it is not possible for scientific information on intelligent extraterrestrial life to conflict with theological information on the same. He also stated that scientific information on intelligent extraterrestrial life can give us insight into the meanings of some Quranic verses like Quran 42:29. If extraterrestrial life is actually discovered in the future, then it might help in giving better insight into the meaning of the word <em>Dabbah</em> in the context of this Quranic verse.</p>
