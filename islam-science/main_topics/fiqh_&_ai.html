<p><strong></strong>Compared to the discussion on consciousness and AI, there have been very limited publications regarding the Fiqh rules related to AI. This topic is very interesting and very relevant for the future. As AI models start to play an increasing role in daily human activities, there is a need to be aware of Islamic laws regarding what tasks AI can and cannot do.</p>

<p>Dr. Yaqub Chaudhary has published an article titled &lsquo;Delegating Religious Practices to Autonomous Machines&rsquo; which is a reply to another article titled &lsquo;Prayer‐Bots and Religious Worship on Twitter: A Call for a Wider Research Agenda&rsquo;. He discusses Muslim Prayer Apps and Prayer-Bots that automatically post prayers on social media. He discusses the issue of intention and comprehension when these tasks are performed by AI. He writes: &ldquo;according to Islamic teachings, all acts of prayer and worship include outward aspects, which are the instructions and rulings given in the Sharia, as well as inward aspects that relate to issues such as intention, presence before God, depth of concentration and contemplation&rdquo;. He also writes: &ldquo;For Islamic theology, intentions are more crucial than actions themselves, since even if an action falls short or is interrupted before actualization, an individual is still rewarded based on their intention&rdquo;. He discusses the issues related to tracing intentional agents in these cases and the acceptability of these prayers. He goes further into discussions on whether such Prayer-Bots or Apps benefit individuals after their death through prayer posts on social media.</p>

<p>Shaykh Musa Furber has done excellent work in the field of Fiqh of AI. However, his work on this topic is still unpublished. Shaykh Musa has attempted to formulate fiqh rules related to AI based on the traditional methodology of the Shafi&rsquo;i school. The following are some major conclusions that he forms in his work based on Shafi&rsquo;i Fiqh:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI is a lifeless and soulless entity that lacks moral capacity and responsibility. This is the case irrespective of how it is implemented, and how well it can match or surpass human intelligence.</li>
<li>AI is considered as a tool (Arabic: ālah).</li>
<li>As a tool, AI can be used for certain permissible activities but not for activities which are prohibited in Islamic law.</li>
<li>Certain acts may be permissible for an AI to perform on behalf of a human, while it is prohibited for a human to engage in it directly.</li>
<li>As a tool, the acts of AI are attributed to its operator, just like other tools. The operator of AI bears responsibility and liability for how it is used and the resulting consequences.</li>
<li>AI cannot be considered responsible and cannot form an intention (niyyah) as per Islamic Law. As a result, it cannot perform certain actions which require responsibility and intention (like prayer and sales contracts). While it cannot do activities like initiating sales contracts for itself, it ought to be able to perform certain actions related to sales as an extension of someone who can.</li>
<li>AI cannot serve as a Mufti or Judge, but may serve as assistants for a Mufti or a Judge. Here, the responsibility for acting based on an AI&rsquo;s findings falls on the Mufti or Judge.</li>
<li>As AI is not alive, our interaction with AI is like our interaction with inanimate objects like rocks, buildings, or vehicles. While AI does not have the sanctity given to ensouled entities, certain rules regarding interactions with inanimate properties would apply.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shaykh Musa also mentions general guidelines for developing AI: its physical appearance should not violate Islamic law, it should serve a lawful purpose, it should be programmed to refrain from unlawful, it should identify itself as an AI and identify who it represents and what it is authorized to perform, and AI&rsquo;s decisions should reflect Islamic decision-making patterns and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Musa mentions that the decisions made by AI should reflect Islamic decision-making patterns. He has previously published a paper titled &lsquo;Islamic Frameworks for Decision-Making&rsquo;. The decision-making process mentioned in that paper can be used as foundation for building Islamic decision-making models for AI.</p>
