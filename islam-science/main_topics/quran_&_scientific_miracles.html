<p class="h2 text-center py-4">QURAN & SCIENTIFIC MIRACLES</p>
<p>The primary miracle of the Quran is its linguistic inimitability. Throughout human history, no one has been able to write something that matches Quran&rsquo;s unmatchable linguistic style and beauty. This enduring miracle has amazed generations of humans from the pagans of seventh century Arabia to people in the current age. In the past few decades there have also been discussions regarding Scientific Miracles in the Quran. However, in the past decades, there have been a lot of limitations in this discussion due to the lack of experts who are well-trained in both scientific discipline and traditional Islamic knowledge tradition. The situation led to the emergence of works that sometimes misinterpreted Quranic verses to suit modern science, or mispresented science to match certain verses in the Quran. However, more recently, there has been a focus on correcting the mistakes made by non-experts in this field. Individuals who are well-versed in both Islamic and Scientific knowledge traditions increasingly are focusing their attention on this field. Currently, a discussion has developed on the validity and relevance of Scientific Miracles in the Quran.</p>

<p>Shaykh Sohaib Saeed recently highlighted the weakness of Scientific Miracles approach and has voiced that the way it is pursued often undermines the process of Tafsir (traditional discipline of Quranic interpretation). Shaykh Sohaib Saeed says about his recent video on Scientific Miracles titled &lsquo;Science and the Quran: A Critique of Weak Arguments for the Truth&rsquo;: &ldquo;This is my defense of Tafsir in the face of certain enthusiastic attempts to make the Quran fit with modern science. My underlying goal is to ensure that we base our faith - and the faith of the next generation - on firm foundations.&rdquo; He lists some common weaknesses and issues with scientific miracle claims as: Missing the point, Attributing ignorance (to early Muslims), Ad hoc arguments, False certainty, and Hafsonormativity (only considering the Hafs Qira&rsquo;at). He has also mentioned that: &ldquo;There are genuine patterns and delightful features in the Quran that increase our amazement at its perfection and beauty, and our conviction that it was revealed by the Almighty, the Wise. But not all such things work as arguments for the sceptic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Shaykh Hamza Karmali has taken a more positive stance towards Scientific Miracles. He argues that certain stringently selected sets of Scientific Miracles are indeed useful. Shaykh Hamza Karmali wrote on X that certain Christian missionaries claim that Muslims who argue for the scientific miracle of the Quran are biased. He mentions that they are wrong and explains the reasons in his video titled &ldquo;Scientific Miracle of the Quran or Cherry Picking?&rdquo; which is a part of his video series titled &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Cosmos&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hamza Tzortis in a 2013 article argued that the Scientific Miracles in the Qur&rsquo;ān narrative is incoherent, and articulated a new approach to reconcile and discuss science in the Qur&rsquo;ān. Dr. Shoaib Ahmed Malik has expressed that he is against the use of the term &lsquo;Scientific Miracles&rsquo;. He agrees that there may be interesting correlations between certain Quranic verses and modern scientific discoveries. However, he has questioned whether these correlations can be termed as Miracles. He has also expressed his concern regarding the misinterpretations and misrepresentations that has been spread by non-experts in the name of Scientific Miracles.</p>

<p>Expert-lead discussions have only started very recently on this topic. Hence, hopefully a lot more can be expected in upcoming years Insha&rsquo;Allah.</p>
