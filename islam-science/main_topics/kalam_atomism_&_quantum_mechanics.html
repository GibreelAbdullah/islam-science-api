<p>Atomism in the Kalam tradition offers a fascinating parallel to modern scientific theories, in the foundational concept of the material world being composed of discrete, indivisible units. The classical Kalam concept of <em>jawahir</em> (fundamental particles or atoms) presents the idea of fundamental units of matter which are indivisible, much like modern subatomic theories. The Kalam tradition assigns accidents (<em>a'rad</em>) for the <em>jawahir</em>, which are properties or qualities that temporarily inhere in the <em>jawahir</em>. The topic is very interesting as modern science has also pursued a similar line, positing that the world is made up of indivisible particles. Dr. Mehmet Bulgen writes: &ldquo;In Islamic thought, the theory of atomism was not a marginal view held by only a few individuals and groups; rather, it was adopted as official doctrine by the majority of Muslim theologians and became a predominant model for explaining reality from the ninth to the twelfth century&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Kalam atomism, the <em>jawahir</em> and <em>a&rsquo;rad</em> are directly created and sustained by God. Any change in their state is directly brought about by God. This is clearly different from Naturalistic understandings of science where atoms and sub-atomic particles only depend on natural laws, and God does not have such a direct role. Although such natural laws were clearly defined in the mechanistic universe of classical physics, in modern quantum physics particles are non-deterministic and do not stick to a single set of natural laws. The strange behaviors observed at the quantum level have perplexed modern scientists and philosophers. Dr. Mehmet Bulgen&rsquo;s and Dr. Basil Altaie&rsquo;s work reveals that Kalam atomism is highly compatible with observations in Quantum Mechanics. Kalam atomism provides an alternate way of providing simple explanations for strange non-deterministic behaviors at the quantum level which are otherwise difficult to explain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many <em>mutakallimun</em> (scholars of the Kalam tradition) considered <em>jawahir</em> as existing only for an instant before being re-created by Allah. This led to a model of a universe that is constantly being re-created by God at every instant. Dr. Basil Altaie has used this model to develop alternate explanations in Quantum Mechanics. He has used the Kalam model to develop a theory where sub-atomic particles like electrons are re-created in every instant. His model provides a very good explanation for certain strange phenomena observed in Quantum Mechanics which are otherwise difficult to comprehend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Mehmet Bulgen has made significant contributions to the study of atomism in the Kalam tradition and in its relation to modern scientific theories. His publications, such as &lsquo;Continuous Re-Creation: From Kalām Atomism to Contemporary Cosmology,&rsquo; reflect his interdisciplinary approach to bridging Kalam tradition with modern science. Dr. Bulgen&rsquo;s work is pivotal in demonstrating how classical Kalam's atomistic framework is still highly relevant today and offers a unique lens for understanding causality, temporality, and the structure of the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Mehmet Bulgen explores how Kalam's idea of continuous creation&mdash;where every moment is seen as a discrete, re-created instance&mdash; influences quantum mechanics interpretations and the nature of space-time. He writes: &ldquo;The<em> mutakallimun</em>, on the basis of the principle of finitude of events (itself based on the impossibility of an actual infinite), defended the view that not only matter but also the entire universe, including space, time, and motion, consists of finite units&rdquo;. He has highlighted the limitations in modern science due to adoption of continuous space-time model in General Relativity, while Quantum Mechanics adopts a discontinous model. He writes: &ldquo;The continuity-discontinuity conflict that exists between general relativity and quantum mechanics is the most important dilemma faced by modern scientific cosmology today. For this reason, there is as yet no comprehensive model for the universe&rdquo;. Kalam atomic model considers the entire universe as discrete units and hence has the advantage of a unified model that explains the whole universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Mehmet Bulgen has also highlighted the occasionalist perspectives of Kalam, which reveals the utter dependence of the universe on God. He has a conference publication titled &lsquo;Reviving Kalām Occasionalism by Ways of Quantum Gravity and Unified Theories&rsquo; highlights his approach of linking Kalam concepts with modern science.</p>
