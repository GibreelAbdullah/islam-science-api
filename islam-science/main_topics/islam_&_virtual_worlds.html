<p>Virtual worlds include online metaverses, online computer games, and video games. In an article published in 2009, Shaykh Musa Furber provided an introduction to the discussion of the ethics of virtual worlds from Islamic perspective. The article takes Linden Lab&rsquo;s <em>Second Life</em> as a case study example for this purpose. This particular game was chosen as it is one interactive virtual world where people spend a great deal of time and money. The activities in some increasingly realistic virtual worlds range from simple conversations to financial transactions, and in some cases even to simulated sex, violence, rape, marriage, and divorce. As a result, there is an increasing need to develop Islamic rules and guidelines regarding activities in virtual worlds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Musa Furber&rsquo;s article goes into a detailed introduction and analysis of <em>Second Life </em>virtual world. He then discusses how Western ethicists have analyzed virtual behavior. The final section of the article presents issues related to virtual worlds which are in need of informed Shari&rsquo;ah reflection. He demonstrates that the classical Islamic tradition already provides answers to many of these issues. He also points out areas that require further research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Musa Furber writes: &ldquo;While virtual worlds must resemble the real-world and may do so to a high degree, they clearly are not identical and it is not sound to presume that virtual-world objects and actions carry the same legal status as their real-world counterparts.&rdquo; Shaykh Musa goes on to cite examples of certain non-physical behaviors discussed in classical Islamic works. These include dreams, thoughts about opposite gender, and looking at reflections of someone otherwise unlawful to look at. He writes: &ldquo;These examples show that the previous generations of scholars were aware of non-physical (virtual) actions, and that they distinguished active participant from mere observation. The examples also show that reflection and mental fantasy are treated as different than what they represent in the real-world, and that there are limits to lawful usage of the imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Musa then lists a range of Fiqh questions that need to be answered regarding the virtual world and interactions in a virtual world. Like: &ldquo;Does a virtual object take the same ruling as the real-world object it represents? Does a computer-generated object representing a pig take the same ruling as a real-world pig? How do actions that take place only within a virtual world differ from actions that cross between the real-world and the virtual? Are actions performed within a virtual world punishable?&rdquo; He also provides examples of answers to some of these questions and general guidance in answering them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He discusses several important questions with respect to sale transactions, marriage, and divorce in the virtual world. He also raises questions regarding general usage like terms of service contracts, digital intellectual properties, settling disputes within the virtual world, and limits to the time spent in virtual worlds. He writes: &ldquo;Contemporary Muslim scholars interested in the issue will find that although virtual worlds are a new technology, many of the inherent legal and ethical issues have already been discussed by prior generations of scholars who strove to apply the Shari&lsquo;ah to every potential situation. Western ethicists have written about the ethics of virtual worlds for over a decade and they have employed a wide-range of ethical systems in their discussions. They, and Muslims, await an Islamic contribution&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He lists some areas for further research which include: Shari&lsquo;ah view non-tangible intellectual properties, guidelines for appropriate online behavior including modesty, lasting negative effects of virtual wrongness, responsibilities of virtual world providers for wrongs done within these worlds, influence of virtual behavior on real-world behavior, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article raises very important questions. There is a need for further studies that conduct in-depth analysis and provide well-researched answers to these questions. There is hope that such studies will be conducted in the upcoming years.</p>
