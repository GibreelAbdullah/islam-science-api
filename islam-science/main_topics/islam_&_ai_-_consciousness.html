<p class="h2 text-center py-4">ISLAM, AI & CONSCIOUSNESS</p>
<p>Recently, discussions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged among Islamic Scholars. The discussions center on two main topics which are:</p>
<ol>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Consciousness and AI.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Fiqh aspects of AI and its use.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Yaqub Chaudhary has recently published a chapter titled <em>Islam and Artificial Intelligence</em> in The Cambridge Companion to Religion and Artificial Intelligence. He provides a good summary of publications and discussions related to Islam and AI. Al Balagh Academy has organized online courses on Islam &amp; Artificial intelligence. It is seen that discussions on Consciousness and AI are currently more developed and common than Fiqh of AI discussions.</p>

<p>Shaykh Faraz A. Khan (a traditional Islamic scholar and theologian) has published a very insightful article titled &lsquo;Can Materialism Explain the Mind?&rsquo;. The article is very relevant to the discussion on consciousness and AI. He also has a good video discussing this topic. He writes: &ldquo;Historically, Muslim theologians generally espoused an integrative substance dualism of body and soul. As Syed Naquib al-Attas defines, &ldquo;Man has a dual nature, he is both body and soul, he is at once physical being and spirit.&rdquo; While Muslim scholastics deemed the essence of the soul to be a mysterious divine secret&mdash;what the mystic Ibn ʿAjībah (d. 1224/1809) termed &ldquo;a luminous, lordly subtlety&rdquo;&mdash;it was evident that the soul is (a) distinct from the body, though deeply integrated with it, and (b) the locus of human consciousness. Yet as spiritual substance, the soul is inaccessible to empirical investigation: consciousness is located in a realm beyond the physical&mdash;not in <em>mulk</em>, the corporeal world, but in <em>malakūt</em>, the spiritual world. The question of its artificial replication is for most theists a nonstarter, since human manipulation is limited to the physical domain. The possibility of replicating consciousness (or generally, any feature of the mind) largely emerges from what is termed naturalism&mdash;the view that all things and events in nature can be explained physically, even if the hard sciences have yet to discover their explanations, because natural processes take place of their own accord. As an explanatory idea, naturalism is most often associated with materialism&mdash;or physicalism&mdash;an ontological position which holds that only &ldquo;physical matter&rdquo; really exists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Faraz discusses recent Western materialist approaches towards consciousness and demonstrates their weaknesses. He writes: &ldquo;Indeed, despite the celebrated achievements of the physical sciences, materialism as an all-encompassing worldview has gradually faded, if not altogether failed, in light of those features of the world that cannot be reduced to physical matter&mdash;morals, values, purpose, meaning, rationality, aesthetics, and&mdash;arguably the most recalcitrant to naturalist reduction&mdash;consciousness. The robust features of human consciousness cannot be dismissed in philosophical deliberation, and philosophical deliberation cannot be forced to fit into the narrow assumptions of scientism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Faraz also writes: &ldquo;The soul, however, is simple indeed. And it is the foundation and basis of the spiritual life of man. The implications of its denial are quite grave, since it is the soul that apprehends meaning, purpose, and virtue. The theologians and mystics of Islam held it to be a secret of the Divine, for only the soul is capable of knowledge&mdash;of oneself, of fellow man, of society, of the cosmos, and of its Creator. And only the soul is capable of love. Among its properties are to seek, yearn, and long for goodness, for truth, for beauty, for intimacy, and ultimately for perfection. The enterprise of scientific discovery itself presupposes this immaterial orientation to these immaterial, transcendental realities: the scientist is impelled by a passion to discover what is true, and deems that pursuit good. Metaphysics accommodates transcendentals, as it accommodates consciousness. At bottom, it would seem that consciousness remains intractable to ontological reduction or elimination. While the human body can be described to a great extent in the language of physics and biochemistry, the human spirit cannot. It must be something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Nazif Muhtaroglu has given an insightful presentation on Strong AI and Consciousness at Cambridge Muslim College. He discusses the approach of the classical Falasifa, Asharis and Matureedis regarding consciousness and the material world. Video recording of this presentation is available online.</p>

<p>Shaykh Musa Furber has conducted in-depth research on AI, particularly focusing on the Fiqh rules related to AI. However, his work on the topic has not been published yet. He discusses the question of life and soul for AI, focusing more on the Fiqh or legal aspect. He has argued that AI does not possess life or soul. He mentions that AI is only a tool (ālah in Arabic), and not a living creature. Hence, AI cannot be described with qualities specific to living entities. He mentions that Muslim theologians usually discuss the soul in the section of samʿīyāt (matters known only through revelation). Therefore, revelation is the primary source for knowing whether a creature possesses a soul or not. He cites the legal principle of <em>istiṣhāb al-ḥāl</em> (presumption of continuity) to show that AI does not possess a soul. Following this legal principle, unless there is any evidence to the contrary, something previously known to be soulless has to be presumed to remain like that. Shaykh Musa Furber also mentions that the same principle can be used for the question of life for an AI. In the absence of contrary evidence, something previously known to be lifeless will be presumed to continue that way. He mentions the qualities and indicators of life mentioned by classical Muslim scholars. He discusses that these qualities cannot be literally attributed to AI. Hence, AI cannot be considered to possess life.</p>
