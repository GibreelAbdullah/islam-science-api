<p class="h2 text-center py-4">HEIGHT OF PROPHET ADAM ﷺ - SCIENCE & HADITH</p>
<p>In February 2022, Mufti Muntasir Zaman published his book titled &lsquo;The Height of Prophet Adam: At the Crossroads of Science and Scripture&rsquo;. Since then, the book has attracted a lot of attention worldwide. The book is a very good example of expert discussion on Science and Hadith. The book primarily engages with the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari and other authentic sources that describe Prophet Adam (a.s.) as being 60 cubits tall. This narration has often raised questions due to its apparent contradiction with scientific and archeological evidence about human height across history. However, Mufti Muntasir mentions that the purpose of the book is not to just focus on this single hadith but to provide general guidelines for discussion on matters where hadith and science seem to contradict each other. He said in his talk on Blogging Theology: &ldquo;Though my research focuses on this specific hadith, what I hope to achieve is provide a framework and model which Muslims can employ when engaging with problematic hadith in general&rdquo;.</p>

<p>He mentioned that the framework used by classical scholars is still very relevant and can be used today for dealing with cases where scientific and archeological objections are raised against certain hadith. He also reveals that classical hadith scholars had already discussed the issues in this particular hadith based on the contentious evidences that were available in the classical period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hadith that is discussed in this book is the following: &ldquo;<span style="color: #ff6600;">Allah created Adam with a height of sixty cubits.</span> He said, &ldquo;Go and greet that group of angels and hear how they return your greeting; that is the greeting for you and your progeny.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Peace be upon you,&rdquo; and they replied, &ldquo;Peace be upon you and Allah&rsquo;s mercy.&rdquo; Thus, they added, &ldquo;and Allah&rsquo;s mercy.&rdquo; Everyone who enters Paradise will be in Adam&rsquo;s image. <span style="color: #ff6600;">And people have been decreasing until this day.</span>&rdquo; (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, no. 3326)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Objections have been raised against the first and last part of this hadith from scientific and archeological perspectives, which include:</p>
<ol>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Collective archeological data broadly demonstrates that over thousands of years in different times and places, there was a relatively customary body size which thus far precludes the notion that our distant ancestors were giants.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Based on Galileo&rsquo;s square-cube law, if a human were to be enlarged while maintaining the same anatomical proportions, the mass would increase by a cubic factor while the cross-sectional area of the muscles and bones would increase only by a square factor.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mufti Muntasir mentions: &ldquo;As I began digging and digging, I realized that this one hadith is at the center of so many contentious issues such as: How much weight do we give to Sahih al Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, What do we do in the face of archeological and scientific conflict, What are Muslims approach towards Israiliyyat (biblical and pre-Islamic narratives), How do we deal with the isolated narrations of some companions to the exclusion of others, so on and so forth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mufti Muntasir mentions that when we have confrontations between science (or archeology) and hadith, the first step is to weigh of each of these two. The strength of the scientific evidence and the certainty of the hadith have to be analyzed. If both sides have relatively strong evidence, then the second step is to consider three options which are:</p>
<ol>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Harmonize both sides through some form of interpretation (taʾwīl).</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Prioritize one side of the conflict (tarjīḥ) based on a wide range of considerations.</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">Suspend judgment on the matter (tawaqquf) in hopes of clarity at a later point.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He goes into detailed discussion on the different routes and variations of the hadith on Prophet Adam&rsquo;s height. He also discusses in the detail the views that classical and modern hadith scholars held regarding this hadith. He discusses the three options of Ta&rsquo;wil, Tarjīh and Tawaqquf and Islamic scholars who adopted these positions. The discussion is very detailed and extremely interesting. It is also difficult to summarize in a few lines. The discussion is available in his book and is summarized in his talk on Blogging Theology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the case study contributes to two broad conversations: (1) the conflict between science and hadith, a crisis of faith for many Muslims today, and (2) the notion that the scholars of Islam&rsquo;s rich intellectual history were oblivious to the issues plaguing the minds of modern Muslims.</p>
