<p>Islam and bioethics field focuses on applying Islamic theological principles and Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) to address contemporary medical and healthcare issues. It examines topics such as end-of-life care, organ transplantation, reproductive technologies, genetic engineering, and public health from an Islamic perspective. Scholars who work in this field aim to integrate modern medical practices with Islamic moral teachings, ensuring that healthcare practices match the religious guidance provided by Islam.

However, there is still scope for further studies on specific issues that are complex and have been differed over like organ transplantation.&nbsp;</p>
