<p class="h2 text-center py-4">ISLAM & ETHICAL USE OF TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>Although a lot of general articles are available regarding the importance of ethical use of technology, there is a lack of works that explore this topic in depth. Shaykh Musa Furber has published a few papers that attempt to go into deeper investigations based on the approach of traditional Islamic Fiqh. His work shows that some answers are readily available in classical Fiqh sources, while other answers can be obtained by extrapolation based on traditional Fiqh methodologies. However, only a very limited amount of work has been done in this direction and there is a pressing need for further in-depth studies on this topic.</p>

<p><strong>Ethical Dimensions of Nanotechnology:</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, Shaykh Musa Furber published a paper on &lsquo;Ethical Dimensions of Nanotechnology&rsquo;. The paper introduces the topic of nanotechnology and its ethical dimensions. It presents a blueprint of the theological, legal, and ethical issues that Muslim scholars and opinion leaders may need to address, as well as a framework through which scholars can begin working out some of the answers. He lists general issues with working with matter at the nanoscale and some issues related to particular application areas. He offers a tentative framework for addressing the legal and ethical issues. He writes: &ldquo;There remains a need to assess individual areas of research or applications on a case by case basis. Textual evidence and legal precedent covering some of these cases may be found, but most will be novel so scholars can weigh each one against the objectives of the Shari&lsquo;ah and legal maxims. In cases where a nanotechnology could be used as a means for performing lawful and unlawful actions, the technology remains lawful in accordance to the principle that things which have the potential to be used for unlawful acts remain permissible so long as the unlawful uses can be avoided. However, in cases where a nanotechnology is inextricably linked to performing the unlawful, then it becomes unlawful following the maxim from jurisprudence that when the lawful and the prohibited are linked together, that the unlawful aspects dominate the ruling&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Musa Furber also writes: &ldquo;The risks to humans and the environment cannot be ignored. This can be shown by extending the last maxim to cases where harm and benefit are linked (after all, harming oneself or others is itself unlawful, and harming others is punishable). This is confirmed by the maxim which states that warding off harms is more important than obtaining benefits; this maxim also sheds light on possibilities for a Shari&rsquo;ah based policy on how nanotechnology should proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also mentions regarding the limitations posed by lack of knowledge regarding the harms of nanotechnology use: &ldquo;Unfortunately, there is not yet conclusive data on what these harms actually are, so scholars need to assess to what degree &ldquo;blocking the means&rdquo; should be applied.&rdquo; He also gives a list of areas for further research in this field.</p>

<p><strong>Obligations to Future Generations:</strong></p>
<p>In 2012, Shaykh Musa Furber published a paper titled &lsquo;Obligations to Future Generations: A Shari&lsquo;ah Perspective&rsquo;. He writes: &ldquo;Actions of an earlier generation affect whether later generations will exist at all as well as the quality and type of life they will have. Discussions concerning the obligations earlier generations owe later generations have proven to be useful when thinking about the environment, economics, sustainability, and other issues&rdquo;. He mentions that Western thought on this topic has grown very sophisticated since the 1970s. He mentions that the Shari&lsquo;ah already provides the fundamentals for thinking about obligations to future generations. However, these fundamentals need to be developed further for the current scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He writes that the topic of obligations to future generations remained largely overlooked until recently. He explains the reason for this as: &ldquo;The most popular explanation for the recent interest is that previous generations lacked the capacity to render extinct or critically impair future generations of man or beast, or to greatly deprive them of resources or well-being&rdquo;. He then explored what contemporary Muslim authors have said on this topic. He says: &ldquo;Several contemporary Muslim authors have alluded to the concept of obligations to future generations in their writings, though none of the writings surveyed have provided compelling proof for such an obligation from within the Shari&lsquo;ah itself.&rdquo; He then goes on to a detailed evaluation of these Muslim authors&rsquo; writings on the matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He discusses classical Islamic sources which are relevant to this topic. He demonstrates that the overall objectives of the Shari&lsquo;ah (<em>maqāṣid al-sharī&lsquo;ah</em>) indicate that future generations of the human species are significant and that current generations do bear obligations towards their welfare. He writes: &ldquo;The existence of the human species is included within the ultimate objective of the Shari&lsquo;ah, and preserving its continued existence is considered a necessity in obtaining well-being. Furthermore, the existence of the human species is a necessary condition for carrying out many of the overall objectives of the Shari&lsquo;ah.&rdquo; He then moves on to a discussion on the tools that the Shari&lsquo;ah offers for thinking about future generations. He says: &ldquo;The Shari&lsquo;ah includes several tools which are useful for thinking about issues that are temporally related, including obligations to future generations; the most important being those tools falling under the general topic of taking consequences into consideration (<em>i&lsquo;tibār al-ma&rsquo;ālāt</em>)&rdquo;. He goes on to detailed discussions on fiqh concepts, practical examples from hadith and Islamic history, and difficulties that need to be overcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He discusses the development of a Shari&rsquo;ah-based framework for this topic. He says: &ldquo;Shari&lsquo;ah experts need to settle several issues before they can build a viable framework for addressing obligations to future generations. These issues include: who owes the obligations, to whom they are owed, what those obligations are, how to decide dilemmas, and how far those obligations extend.&rdquo; He goes on to discuss personal obligations (<em>farḍ al-&lsquo;ayn</em>) and communal or collective obligations (<em>farḍ al-kifāyah</em>). He writes: &ldquo;It seems that obligations to future generations fit well within the category of communal obligations since the various individual obligations owed to future generations can be fulfilled by individuals or segments of the total population, and do not require active participation from each individual member of the entire group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, he proposes specific content for obligations to future generations in the form of general and specific objectives. He also discusses the obligations regarding non-renewable resources. He writes: &ldquo;It is important to ensure that each generation preserves what is owed to those of the future since securing and protecting the prerequisites for life are an essential part of a viable framework of obligations to future generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He mentions in the conclusion section: &ldquo;Whereas Western conceptions of these obligations have difficulty identifying interests on the grounds that values and interests change from generation to generation, the overall objectives of the Shari&lsquo;ah are constant and immutable. Shari&lsquo;ah experts can further develop this framework into a viable alternative to Western models that can be used in a manner harmonious to the Shari&lsquo;ah and pleasing to Allah Most High.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Intensive Animal Farming:</strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Musa Furber has published two papers related to this topic. In 2015 he published the paper &lsquo;Rights and duties pertaining to kept animals: A Case Study in Islamic Law and Ethics&rsquo;. In 2017 he published the paper &lsquo;Intensive Animal Farming: Wrongs &amp; Responsibilities&rsquo;. The first paper presents a survey of Quranic verses and Prophetic Hadith related to kept animals, and how the Shafi&rsquo;i school of Fiqh applied these evidences to the topic of kept animals. The second paper explores intensive animal farming practiced in today&rsquo;s world, specifically focusing on the issue of animal welfare and how these animals are kept - as the mistreatment of animals according to the Islamic Sacred Law is wrong even in the absence of other considerations. By applying the principles of Islamic jurisprudence and ethics to this question, he explores our responsibilities towards the animals being kept and industrially farmed on our behalf, and concludes with suggestions for potential improvements. Both papers are very detailed in nature and together contribute a great deal to this topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first paper, Shaykh Musa lists the various rules and guidelines regarding the good treatment of kept animals mentioned in classical Shafi&rsquo;i fiqh books for various kinds of animals. He demonstrates that these rules are quite detailed. He presents some early shafi&rsquo;i fiqh works which specifically included sections on the treatment of animals: <em>Qawāʿid al-aḥkām fī maṣāliḥ al-anām </em>and <em>Shajarat al-maʿārif wa al-aḥwāl </em>Classical Shafi&rsquo;i jusrist Shaykh Al-ʿIzz ibn ʿAbd al-Salām. He writes: &ldquo;It is a religious obligation that keepers of animals provide sufficient upkeep for their animals. This upkeep is a requirement of keeping any creature possessing a soul. This requirement can be enforced by the authorities; in some situations, the Muslim community may be required to assist in providing for the animal. It is also a religious obligation to treat animals with all manners of mercy and kindness, and to avoid unnecessarily harming or annoying them in any way. These attitudes and concerns informed Islam&rsquo;s worldview and social philosophy. They were reflected in Muslim history, as can be seen in the many endowments that were established for the sake of providing for animals&rdquo;. He also writes: &ldquo;It is important to reiterate that these rulings are not something optional that Muslims are just free to take or leave as they see fit. The obligation to provide for kept animals is a personal obligation upon anyone who keeps animals. The prohibitions against animal abuse are personal obligations upon all people who encounter non-aggressive animals. Failing to act according to these obligations and prohibitions is disobedience against Allah and His Messenger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second paper mentions that our concern should not be limited to how we keep our own animals, but rather it should extend to how animals are kept on our behalf. He mentions regarding intensive animal farming: &ldquo;This form of farming was designed with the sole purpose of efficient maximization of profits, and in many countries it is supply driven&mdash;not demand driven&rdquo;. He lists the major issues with intensive animal farming, and discusses issues relating to animal welfare specifically. He then writes: &ldquo;The situation described above is at odds with the Sacred Law. Indeed, the Sacred Law requires that something be done to rectify the situation. I will show why this is so for individuals who keep animals, trade in their products, and consume them &hellip;. The main point of this essay is to argue that Muslims in general should be concerned with how the animals whose products they consume are raised&mdash;and that these concerns are not limited to individuals who keep and raise animals.&rdquo; He goes into detailed discussions based on Islamic law regarding the permissibility of hunting and animal slaughter, excessive consumption, the importance of raising and keeping animals as per Islamic sacred law, and the responsibility of individuals who buy from sources where abuse is endemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Musa writes: &ldquo;A legal maxim states &ldquo;whatever is unlawful to perform is unlawful to request&rdquo;. Ordering animals from a farm where abuse is inevitable is, in effect, a request to abuse animals and, thus, unlawful&rdquo;. He goes further: &ldquo;And the wrongness does not stop here. Engaging in a transaction that one knows provides a means to the unlawful is unlawful, even if the transaction itself is valid. If one merely suspects that it provides a means to the unlawful, then it is offensive&rdquo;. He then discusses the command to avoid unlawful and doubtful foods and the enduring effect of disobedience. He quotes Shaykh Nuh Keller: &ldquo;Everyone knows that unslaughtered meat is haram to eat, but few realize how little baraka [n.b. blessing] there is in even slaughtered meat when the animals have been raised in misery and suffering, or when cooked by those of indifferent morals. One should be aware of what one is doing to oneself&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaykh Musa Furber writes: &ldquo;All of the things mentioned above show that the wrongs involved with animal farming are not limited to individuals who keep animals. Everyone involved in the production and consumption of factory-farmed animal products is engaging in wrongs of one form or another. The wrongs of animal abuse are not limited to the abuser and the abused. Rather, those wrongs extend to everyone involved. And rectifying them is a communal responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He finally mentions that the authorities and Muslim individuals have a responsibility to rectify this situation. He also provides practical recommendations for Muslims.</p>
