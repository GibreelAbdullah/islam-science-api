<p class="h2 text-center py-4">ABOUT</p>
<p>This website emerged from discussions between some Muslim Alumni of an engineering university in India. The
    discussions centered on doing something beneficial for the Ummah based on the technical knowledge gained at the
    university. This project came up during the discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there have been several major developments in the field of Islam, Science, and Technology in recent years,
    there is no book, website, or App that provides a list and summary of these developments. The purpose of this
    website is simply to serve as a beginning and as a motivation for other such efforts. We hope that others will build
    websites that will better serve this purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May Allah make this a source of benefit for all Muslims, and all of humanity in general. Amin.</p>
